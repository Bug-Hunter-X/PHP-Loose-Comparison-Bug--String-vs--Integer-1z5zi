This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling and loose comparison.  The `if` condition uses loose comparison (`==`), which leads to unexpected results when comparing strings and integers. 

```php
<?php
$a = "10";
$b = 10;
if ($a == $b) {
  echo "They are equal!";
} else {
  echo "They are not equal!";
}
?>
```

The output will be "They are equal!" because PHP converts the string "10" to an integer 10 before the comparison. This might work as expected in some situations but can lead to errors in others.
