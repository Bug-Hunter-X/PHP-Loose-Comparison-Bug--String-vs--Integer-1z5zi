This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in PHP related to loose comparisons.  The example shows how comparing a string and an integer using the `==` operator can lead to unexpected results due to PHP's type juggling behavior.  The solution demonstrates the use of strict comparison (`===`) to avoid this problem.  This is a critical point to understand for building robust PHP applications.
